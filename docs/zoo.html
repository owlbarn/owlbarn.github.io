<h1>Scripting and Zoo System</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we introduce the Zoo system, and focus on two aspects of it. The first is how to use it to make “small functions”, then distribute and share them with other users. The second is to investigate the idea of service composing and deployment based on existing script sharing function</p>
<section class="level2" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>First, we would like to introduce the background based on which we build the Zoo system. Currently, many popular data analytics services such as machine learning applications are deployed on cloud computing infrastructures. However, they require aggregating users’ data at central server for processing. This architecture is prone to issues such as increased service response latency, communication cost, single point failure, and data privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Recently computation on edge and mobile devices has gained rapid growth, such as personal data analytics in home, DNN application on a tiny stick, and semantic search and recommendation on web browser. Edge computing is also boosting content distribution by supporting peering and caching. HUAWEI has identified speed and responsiveness of native AI processing on mobile devices as the key to a new era in smartphone innovation.</p>
<p>Many challenges arise when moving ML analytics from cloud to edge devices. One widely discussed challenge is the limited computation power and working memory of edge devices. Personalising analytics models on different edge devices is also a very interesting topic. However, one problem is not yet well defined and investigated: the deployment of data analytics services. Most existing machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Caffe focus mainly on the training of analytics models. On the other, the end users, many of whom are not ML professionals, mainly use trained models to perform inference. This gap between the current ML systems and users’ requirements is growing.</p>
<p>Another challenge in conducting ML based data analytics on edge devices is model composition. Training a model often requires large datasets and rich computing resources, which are often not available to normal users. That’s one of the reasons that they are bounded with the models and services provided by large companies. To this end we propose the idea <em>Composable Service</em>. Its basic idea is that many services can be constructed from basic ML ones such as image recognition, speech-to-text, and recommendation to meet new application requirements. We believe that modularity and composition will be the key to increasing usage of ML-based data analytics. This idea drives us to develop the Zoo system.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="share-script-with-zoo">
<h2>Share Script with Zoo</h2>
<p>The core functionality of the Zoo is simple: sharing OCaml scripts. It is known that we can use OCaml as a scripting language as Python (at certain performance cost because the code is compiled into bytecode). Even though compiling into native code for production use is recommended, scripting is still useful and convenient, especially for light deployment and fast prototyping. In fact, the performance penalty in most Owl scripts is almost unnoticeable because the heaviest numerical computation part is still offloaded to Owl which runs native code.</p>
<p>While designing Owl, our goal is always to make the whole ecosystem open, flexible, and extensible. Programmers can make their own “small” scripts and share them with others conveniently, so they do not have to wait for such functions to be implemented in Owl’s master branch or submit something “heavy” to OPAM.</p>
<section class="level3" id="typical-scenario">
<h3>Typical Scenario</h3>
<p>To illustrate how to use Zoo, let’s start with a simple synthetic scenario. Alice is a data analyst and uses Owl in her daily job. One day, she realised that the functions she needed had not been implemented yet in Owl. Therefore, she spent an hour in her computer and implemented these functions by herself. She thought these functions might be useful to others, e.g., her colleague Bob, she decided to share these functions using Zoo System. Now let’s see how Alice manages to do so in the following, step by step.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="create-a-script">
<h3>Create a Script</h3>
<p>First, Alice needs to create a folder (e.g., <code>myscript</code> folder) for her shared script. What to put in the folder then? She needs at least two files in this folder. The first one is of course the file (i.e., <code>coolmodule.ml</code>) implementing the function as below. The function <code>sqr_magic</code> returns the square of a magic matrix, it is quite useless in reality but serves as an example here.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">#!/usr/bin/env owl

open Owl

let sqr_magic n = Mat.(magic n |&gt; sqr)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The second file she needs is a <code>#readme.md</code> which provides a brief description of the shared script. Note that the first line of the <code>#readme.md</code> will be used as a short description for the shared scripts. This short description will be displayed when you use <code>owl -list</code> command to list all the available Zoo code snippets on your computer.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">Square of Magic Matrix

`Coolmodule` implements a function to generate the square of magic matrices.</code></pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="share-via-gist">
<h3>Share via Gist</h3>
<p>Second, Alice needs to distribute the files in <code>myscript</code> folder. The distribution is done via <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>, so you must have <code>gist</code> installed on your computer. E.g., if you use Mac, you can install <code>gist</code> with <code>brew install gist</code>. Owl provides a simple command line tool to upload the Zoo code snippets. Note that you need to log into your GitHub account for <code>gist</code> and <code>git</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">owl -upload myscript</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>owl -upload</code> command simply uploads all the files in <code>myscript</code> as a bundle to your Gist page. The command also prints out the URL after a successful upload. In our case, you can check the updated bundle on <a href="https://gist.github.com/9f0892ab2b96f81baacd7322d73a4b08">this page</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="import-in-another-script">
<h3>Import in Another Script</h3>
<p>The bundle Alice uploaded before is assigned a unique <code>id</code>, i.e.&nbsp;<code>9f0892ab2b96f81baacd7322d73a4b08</code>. In order to use the <code>sqr_magic</code> function, Bob only needs to use the <code>#zoo</code> directive in his script e.g.&nbsp;<code>bob.ml</code> in order to import the function.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">#!/usr/bin/env owl
#zoo "9f0892ab2b96f81baacd7322d73a4b08"

let _ = Coolmodule.sqr_magic 4 |&gt; Owl.Mat.print</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Bob’s script is very simple, but there are a couple of things worth pointing out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Zoo system will automatically download the bundle of a given id if it is not cached locally;</p></li>
<li><p>All the <code>ml</code> files in the bundle will be imported as modules, so you need to use <code>Coolmodule.sqr_magic</code> to access the function.</p></li>
<li><p>You may also want to use <code>chmod +x bob.ml</code> to make the script executable. This is obvious if you are a heavy terminal user.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that to use <code>#zoo</code> directive in <code>utop</code> you need to manually load the <code>owl-zoo</code> library with <code>#require "owl-zoo";;</code>. Alternatively, you can also load <code>owl-top</code> using <code>#require "owl-top";;</code> which is an OCaml toplevel wrapper of Owl. If you want to make <code>utop</code> load the library automatically by adding this line to <code>~/.ocamlinit</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="select-a-specific-version">
<h3>Select a Specific Version</h3>
<p>Alice has modified and uploaded her scripts several times. Each version of her code is assigned a unique <code>version id</code>. Different versions of code may work differently, so how could Bob specify which version to use? Good news is that, he barely needs to change his code.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">
  #!/usr/bin/env owl
  #zoo "9f0892ab2b96f81baacd7322d73a4b08?vid=71261b317cd730a4dbfb0ffeded02b10fcaa5948"

  let _ = Coolmodule.sqr_magic 4 |&gt; Owl.Mat.print
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The only thing he needs to add is a version id using the parameter <code>vid</code>. The naming scheme of Zoo is designed to be similar with the field-value pair in a RESTful query. Version id can be obtained from a gist’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/9f0892ab2b96f81baacd7322d73a4b08/revisions">revisions page</a>.</p>
<p>Besides specifying a version, it is also quite possible that Bob prefers to use the newest version Alice provides, whatever its id may be. The problem here is that, how often does Bob need to contact the Gist server to retreat the version information? Every time he runs his code? Well, that may not be a good idea in many cases considering the communication overhead and response time. Zoo caches gists locally and tends to use the cached code and data rather than downloading them all the time.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Zoo provides another parameter in the naming scheme: <code>tol</code>. It is the threshold of a gist’s <em>tolerance</em> of the time it exists on the local cache. Any gist that exists on a user’s local cache for longer than <code>tol</code> seconds is deemed outdated and thus requires updating the latest <code>vid</code> information from the Gist server before being used. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">
  #!/usr/bin/env owl
  #zoo "9f0892ab2b96f81baacd7322d73a4b08?tol=300"

  let _ = Coolmodule.sqr_magic 4 |&gt; Owl.Mat.print
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>By setting the <code>tol</code> parameter to 300, Bob indicates that, if Zoo has already fetched the version information of this gist from remote server within the past 300 seconds, then keep using its local cache; otherwise contact the Gist server to check if a newer version is pushed. If so, the newest version is downloaded to local cache before being used. In the case where Bob don’t want to miss every single update of Alice’s gist code, he can simply set <code>tol</code> to 0, which means fetching the version information every time he executes his code.</p>
<p>The <code>vid</code> and <code>tol</code> parameters enable users to have fine-grained version control of Zoo gists. Of course, these two parameters should not be used together. When <code>vid</code> is set in a name, the <code>tol</code> parameter will be ignored. If both are not set, as shown in the previous code snippet, Zoo will use the latest locally cached version if it exists.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="command-line-tool">
<h3>Command Line Tool</h3>
<p>You can see that the Zoo system is not complicated at all. There will be more features to be added in future. For the time being, you can check all the available options by executing <code>owl</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">
  $ owl
  Owl's Zoo System

  Usage:
    owl [utop options] [script-file]  execute an Owl script
    owl -upload [gist-directory]      upload code snippet to gist
    owl -download [gist-id] [ver-id]  download code snippet from gist; download the latest version if ver-id not specified
    owl -remove [gist-id]             remove a cached gist
    owl -update [gist-ids]            update (all if not specified) gists
    owl -run [gist-id]                run a self-contained gist
    owl -info [gist-ids]              show the basic information of a gist
    owl -list [gist-id]               list all cached versions of a gist; list all the cached gists if gist-id not specified
    owl -help                         print out help information
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that both <code>run</code> and <code>info</code> commands accept a full gist name that can contain extra parameters, instead of only a gist id.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="more-examples">
<h3>More Examples</h3>
<p>Despite of its simplicity, Zoo is a very flexible and powerful tool and we have been using it heavily in our daily work. We often use Zoo to share the prototype code and small shared modules which we do not want to bother OPAM, such as those used in performance tests. Moreover, many interesting examples are also built atop of Zoo system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/9428a62a31dbea75511882ab8218076f">Google Inception V3 for Image Classification</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/6f28d54e69d1a19c1819f52c5b16c1a1">Neural Style Transfer</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/f937ce439c8adcaea23d42753f487299">Fast Neural Style Transfer</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can use Zoo to perform DNN-based image classification in only 6 lines of code:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-shell">
  #!/usr/bin/env owl
  #zoo "9428a62a31dbea75511882ab8218076f"

  let _ =
    let image  = "/path/to/your/image.png" in
    let labels = InceptionV3.infer image in
    InceptionV3.to_json ~top:5 labels
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We include these examples as use cases in the Part III of this book, and will discuss them in detail there.</p>

<h2>System Design</h2>
<p>Based on these basic functionalities, we extend the Zoo system to address the composition and deployment challenges we mention at the beginning. First, we would like to briefly introduce the workflow of Zoo as shown in <span data-cites="fig:zoo:workflow" class="citation">[@fig:zoo:workflow]</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img style="width:70.0%" id="fig:zoo:workflow" alt="Zoo System Architecture" src="images/zoo/workflow.png"><figcaption>Zoo System Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>
<section class="level3" id="services">
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>Gist is a core abstraction in Zoo. It is the centre of code sharing. However, to compose multiple analytics snippets, Gist alone is insufficient. For example, it cannot express the structure of how different pieces of code are composed together. Therefore, we introduce another abstraction: <code>service</code>.</p>
<p>A service consists of three parts: <em>Gists</em>, <em>types</em>, and <em>dependency graph</em>. <em>Gists</em> is the list of Gist ids this service requires. <em>Types</em> is the parameter types of this service. Any service has zero or more input parameters and one output. This design follows that of an OCaml function. <em>Dependency graph</em> is a graph structure that contains information about how the service is composed. Each node in it represents a function from a Gist, and contains the Gist’s name, id, and number of parameters of this function.</p>
<p>Zoo provides three core operations about a service: create, compose, and publish. &nbsp;The <em>create_service</em> creates a dictionary of services given a Gist id. This operation reads the service configuration file from that Gist, and creates a service for each function specified in the configuration file. The <em>compose_service</em> provides a series of operations to combine multiple services into a new service. A compose operation does type checking by comparing the “types” field of two services. An error will be raised if incompatible services are composed. A composed service can be saved to a new Gist or be used for further composition. The <em>publish_service</em> makes a service’s code into such forms that can be readily used by end users. Zoo is designed to support multiple backends for these publication forms. Currently it targets Docker container, JavaScript, and MirageOS as backends.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="type-checking">
<h3>Type Checking</h3>
<p>One of the most important tasks of service composition is to make sure the type matches. For example, suppose there is an image analytics service that takes a PNG format image, and if we connect to it another one that produces a JPEG image, the resulting service will only generate meaningless output for data type mismatch. OCaml provides primary types such as integer, float, string, and bool. The core data structure of Owl is ndarray (or tensor as it is called in some other data analytics frameworks). However, all these types are insufficient for high level service type checking as mentioned. That motives us to derive richer high-level types.</p>
<p>To support it, we use generalised algebraic data types (GADTs) in OCaml. There already exist several model collections on different platforms, e.g.&nbsp;Caffe&nbsp;and MxNet. We observe that most current popular deep learning (DL) models can generally be categorised into three fundamental types: <code>image</code>, <code>text</code>, and <code>voice</code>. Based on them, we define sub-types for each: PNG and JPEG image, French and English text and voice, i.e.&nbsp;<code>png img</code>, <code>jpeg img</code>, <code>fr text</code>, <code>en text</code>, <code>fr voice</code>, and <code>en voice</code> types. More can be further added easily in Zoo. Therefore type checking in OCaml ensures type-safe and meaningful composition of high level services.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="backend">
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>Recognising the heterogeneity of edge device deployment, one key principle of Zoo is to support multiple deployment methods. Containerisation as a lightweight virtualisation technology has gained enormous traction. It is used in deployment systems such as Kubernetes. Zoo supports deploying services as Docker containers. Each container provides RESTful API for end users to query.</p>
<p>Another backend is JavaScript. Using JavaScript to do analytics aside from front end development begins to attract interests from academia&nbsp;and industry, such as Tensorflow.js and Facebook’s Reason language. By exporting OCaml and Owl functions to JavaScript code, users can do complex data analytics on web browser directly without relying on any other dependencies.</p>
<p>Aside from these two backends, we also initially explore using MirageOS as an option. Mirage is an example of Unikernel, which builds tiny virtual machines with a specialised minimal OS that host only one target application. Deploying to Unikernel is proved to be of low memory footprint, and thus quite suitable for resource-limited edge devices.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="domain-specific-language">
<h3>Domain Specific Language</h3>
<p>Based on the basic functionalities, Zoo aims to provide a minimal DSL for service composition and deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Composition</strong>:</p>
<p>To acquire services from a Gist of id <em>gid</em>, we use <span class="math inline">\(\$gid\)</span> to create a dictionary, which maps from service name strings to services. We implement the dictionary data structure using <code>Hashtbl</code> in OCaml. The <span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span> operator is overloaded to represent the “get item” operation. Therefore, <span class="math display">\[\$\textrm{gid} \# \textrm{sname}\]</span> can be used to get a service that is named “sname”. Now suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> services: <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(f_n\)</span>. Their outputs are of type <span class="math inline">\(t_{f1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t_{f2}\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(t_{fn}\)</span>. Each service <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> accepts <span class="math inline">\(m_s\)</span> input parameters, which have type <span class="math inline">\(t_s^1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t_s^2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(t_s^{m_s}\)</span>. Also, there is a service <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> that takes <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> inputs, each of them has type <span class="math inline">\(t_g^1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t_g^2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(t_g^n\)</span>. Its output type is <span class="math inline">\(t_o\)</span>. Here Zoo provides the <code>$&gt;</code> operator to compose a list of services with another: <span class="math display">\[[f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n] \textrm{\$&gt;} g\]</span> This operation returns a new service that has <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{s=1}^{n} m_s\)</span> inputs, and is of output type <span class="math inline">\(t_o\)</span>. This operation does type checking to make sure that <span class="math inline">\(t_{fi} = t_g^i, \forall i \in {1, 2, \ldots, n}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>:</p>
<p>Taking a service <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, be it a basic or composed one, it can be deployed using the following syntax:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s \textrm{\$@ backend}\]</span></p>
<p>The <code>$@</code> operator publish services to certain backend. It returns a string of URI of the resources to be deployed.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>$&gt;</code> operator leads to a tree-structure, which is in most cases sufficient for our real-world service deployment. However, a more general operation is to support graph structure. This will be our next-step work.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="service-discovery">
<h3>Service Discovery</h3>
<p>The services require a service discovery mechanism. For simplicity’s sake, each newly published service is added to a public record hosted on a server. The record is a list of items, and each item contains the Gist id that service based on, a one-line description of this service, string representation of the input types and output type of this service, e.g. “image -&gt; int -&gt; string -&gt; tex”, and service URI. For the container deployment, the URI is a DockerHub link, and for JavaScript backend, the URI is a URL link to the JavaScript file itself. The service discovery mechanism is implemented using off-the-shelf database.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="use-case">
<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>To illustrate the workflow above, let’s consider another synthetic scenario. Alice is a French data analyst. She knows how to use ML and DL models in existing platforms, but is not an expert. Her recent work is about testing the performance of different image classification neural networks. To do that, she needs to first modify the image using the DNN-based Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm. The NST algorithm takes two images and outputs to a new image, which is similar to the first image in content and the second in style. This new image should be passed to an image classification DNN for inference. Finally, the classification result should be translated to French. She does not want to put academic-related information on Google’s server, but she cannot find any single pre-trained model that performs this series of tasks.</p>
<p>Here comes the Zoo system to help. Alice finds gists that can do image recognition, NST, and translation separately. Even better, she can perform image segmentation to greatly improve the performance of NST using another Gist. All she has to provide is some simple code to generate the style images she need to use. She can then assemble these parts together easily using Zoo.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">open Zoo
(* Image classification *)
let s_img = $ "aa36e" # "infer";;
(* Image segmentation *)
let s_seg = $ "d79e9" # "seg";;
(* Neural style transfer *)
let s_nst = $ "6f28d" # "run";;
(* Translation from English to French *)
let s_trans = $ "7f32a" # "trans";;
(* Alice's own style image generation service *)
let s_style = $ alice_Gist_id # "image_gen";;

(* Compose services *)
let s = [s_seg; s_style] $&gt; s_nst
    $&gt; n_img $&gt; n_trans;;
(* Publish to a new Docker Image *)
let pub = (List.hd s) $@
    (CONTAINER "alice/image_service:latest");;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the Gist id used in the code is shorted from 32 digits to 5 due to column length limit. Once Alice creates the new service and published it as a container, she can then run it locally and send request with image data to the deployed machine, and get image classification results back in French.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Zoo system was first developed as a handy tool for sharing OCaml scripts. This chapter introduces how it works with a step-by-step example.

Zoo provides a simple DSL to enable easy and type-safe composition of different advanced services. We present a use case to show the expressiveness of the code. Zoo can further be combined with multiple execution backends to accommodate the heterogeneous edge deployment environment. The compiler backends will be discussed in the next chapter.
