<meta name="description" content="Introduction Red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It was invented in 1972 by Rudolf Bayer who called them “symmetric binary B-trees,” but acquired its modern name in a paper in 1978 by Leo J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick. Red-black trees are often used in C++ STL (Standard Template Library) implementation of map and set. Implementation Here is an implementation of the red-black tree in OCaml: type color = Red | Black type &#39;a tree = | Leaf | Node of color * &#39;a tree * &#39;a * &#39;a tree let balance = function | Black, Node (Red, Node (Red, a, x, b), y, c), z, d | Black, Node (Red, a, x, Node (Red, b, y, c)), z, d | Black, a, x, Node (Red, Node (Red, b, y, c), z, d) | Black, a, x, Node (Red, b, y, Node (Red, c, z, d)) -&gt; Node (Red, Node (Black, a, x, b), y, Node (Black, c, z, d)) | color, left, value, right -&gt; Node (color, left, value, right) let rec insert x = function | Leaf -&gt; Node (Red, Leaf, x, Leaf) | Node (color, left, value, right) as node -&gt; if x &lt; value then balance (color, insert x left, value, right) else if x &gt; value then balance (color, left, value, insert x right) else node Here, we define the type of color as either Red or Black. We also define the type of a tree as either a Leaf or a Node with a color, left subtree, value, and right subtree. The balance function takes a tuple and returns a balanced node. The insert function takes a value and a tree and returns a new tree with the value inserted in the correct position. Step-by-step Explanation A new node is always inserted as a red node. If the node is the root node, it is colored black. If the parent of a red node is also red, the tree is rebalanced. If a node is red, its children must be black. The black height of a subtree must be equal on both sides. When rebalancing, the red node is rotated and recolored to maintain the above properties. Complexity Analysis The worst-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations in a red-black tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the height of a red-black tree is always log n. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node requires a constant amount of memory." />

<p>Here, we define the type of color as either Red or Black. We also define the type of a tree as either a Leaf or a Node with a color, left subtree, value, and right subtree. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">balance</code> function takes a tuple and returns a balanced node. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insert</code> function takes a value and a tree and returns a new tree with the value inserted in the correct position.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step-explanation">Step-by-step Explanation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A new node is always inserted as a red node.</li>
  <li>If the node is the root node, it is colored black.</li>
  <li>If the parent of a red node is also red, the tree is rebalanced.</li>
  <li>If a node is red, its children must be black.</li>
  <li>The black height of a subtree must be equal on both sides.</li>
  <li>When rebalancing, the red node is rotated and recolored to maintain the above properties.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="complexity-analysis">Complexity Analysis</h2>
<p>The worst-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations in a red-black tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the height of a red-black tree is always log n. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node requires a constant amount of memory.</p>
