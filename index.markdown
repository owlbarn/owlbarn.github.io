Owl is a dedicated system for scientific and engineering computing. It is designed in the functional programming language OCaml. The project is led by [Liang Wang](https://liang.ocaml.xyz). The source code is licensed under MIT.


## Misson

Our mission is to push the frontier of high-performance scientific computing, provide both researchers and industry programmers a powerful framework to write concise, fast and safe analytical code. The system aims to serve as the de-facto tool for computation intensive tasks in OCaml.

The project produces comprehensive learning materials to promote OCaml learning. You can learn how to use Owl using the online documentation and following books.
