Owl is a dedicated system for scientific and engineering computing. It is designed in the functional programming language OCaml. The project is led by [Liang Wang](https://liang.ocaml.xyz). The source code is licensed under MIT.


## Misson

Our mission is to push the frontier of high-performance scientific computing, provide both researchers and industry programmers a powerful framework to write concise, fast and safe analytical code. The system aims to serve as the de-facto tool for computation intensive tasks in OCaml.


## Books

The project produces comprehensive learning materials to promote OCaml learning. You can learn how to use Owl using the online documentation and following books.

- [<< OCaml Scientific Computing >>](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030976446)
- [<< Architecture of Numerical Software >>]() coming soon ...


## Sponsor

Owl owes a great debt of gratitude to its generous sponsors, contributors, and other open source projects. Please refer to our Sponsors, Backers, and Contributors.
